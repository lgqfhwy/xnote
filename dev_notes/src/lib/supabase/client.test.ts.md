# File: src/lib/supabase/client.test.ts

## 1. File-Level Overview

- Module Purpose: Verifies Supabase client initialization and presence of expected methods.
- Role in Project: Unit tests for the data access bootstrap; ensures environment-based construction works in test environment.
- Key Dependencies:
  - `jest` and test runtime: for module mocking and assertions.
  - The local module `./client`: subject under test.

## 2. Global Variables and Definitions

- None beyond Jest's describe/it scopes.

## 3. Detailed Breakdown of Functions and Tests

### Suite: `describe('Supabase Client', ... )`

- Functionality: Groups tests validating client creation and API surface.

#### Test: `beforeAll` / `afterAll`

- Functionality: Sets and cleans env vars required by the client module.
- Parameters: N/A
- Return Value: N/A
- Core Implementation Logic:
  1. Set `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` prior to module import.
  2. After tests, delete the variables to avoid cross-test pollution.

#### Test: `it('initializes the Supabase client')`

- Functionality: Dynamically imports `./client` and asserts `supabase` is defined and non-null.
- Core Implementation Logic:
  1. Use dynamic `import('./client')` to evaluate module with env set.
  2. Check `supabase` exists.
- Example Usage:
  ```ts
  const { supabase } = await import('./client')
  expect(supabase).toBeDefined()
  ```

#### Test: `it('has the expected auth method')`

- Functionality: Checks that `supabase.auth` API namespace exists and has object type.
- Core Implementation Logic: Import, then `expect(typeof supabase.auth).toBe('object')`.

#### Test: `it('has the expected from method')`

- Functionality: Ensures query builder entry `supabase.from` exists and is callable.
- Core Implementation Logic: Import, then `expect(typeof supabase.from).toBe('function')`.

## 4. Overall Logic & Interaction

The test file configures env variables, then loads the client module to validate construction and a minimal API surface. This confirms integration points for downstream data operations are present without requiring network calls.
