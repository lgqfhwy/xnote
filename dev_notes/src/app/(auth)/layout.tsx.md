# File: src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx

## 1. File-Level Overview

- Module Purpose: Provides a layout wrapper for auth-related pages and forces dynamic rendering.
- Role in Project: Route group layout for the `(auth)` segment in Next.js app directory.
- Key Dependencies: None beyond React types and Next.js conventions.

## 2. Global Variables and Definitions

- `dynamic: 'force-dynamic'` — Ensures auth pages skip static generation.

## 3. Detailed Breakdown of Components

### Component: `AuthLayout({ children })`

- Functionality: Simple pass-through that renders `children` directly.
- Parameters:
  - `children: React.ReactNode` (required) — Nested route content.
- Return Value: `JSX.Element` (children).
- Core Implementation Logic:
  1. Export `dynamic` for runtime behavior.
  2. Export default layout component that returns `children`.
- Example Usage: Applied implicitly by Next.js to routes under `(auth)`.

## 4. Overall Logic & Interaction

This layout file establishes rendering mode while letting nested pages fully control their UI; it does not add chrome around auth pages.
