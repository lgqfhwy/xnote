## 3. Detailed Breakdown of Functions and Classes

- Not applicable; this file only supplies type references and contains no executable code.

## 4. Overall Logic & Interaction

This auto-generated file ensures TypeScript tooling recognizes Next.js types across the codebase. It should not be edited manually and is consumed by the compiler during type checking.
